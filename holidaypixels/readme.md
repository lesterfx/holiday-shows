# Holiday Pixels

Holiday pixels is built to handle a pixel strip and relays for use in a holiday light show. It includes a number of realtime animations, with underlying physics system. It also includes images, with all corresponding projects, for several animations, including my Christmas light show (see https://youtu.be/TRXpL8alP7s).

Higher level, it also handles scheduling of different animations throughout the year, and time of day for running the display.
